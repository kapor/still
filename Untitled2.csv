11;American President, The;Kunhardt, Philip B., Kunhardt, Peter W.;1999;Hardcover w/ jacket;Riverhead;N/A;Used, Good Condition;45;Sycamore:;History, America, Reference;NULL;NULL;N;"The American President has the looks of a coffee-table book, the smarts of an academic tome, and the readability of a novel, full of interesting and little-known facts about the first 41 chief executives of the United States. (Bill Clinton is the 42nd president, but Grover Cleveland was elected president twice, before and after Benjamin Harrison, making him the 22nd and 24th president.) The Kunhardt family are producers of both historical books and documentaries, and their television background is evident in the visual emphasis within The American President--which, as it happens, is also being turned into a television documentary. Another thing that sets the book apart from countless others on the presidents is its unique organization. The presidents are not presented in chronological order, but grouped instead according to characteristics that personified them and their presidencies. For example, Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson are brought together in a chapter on professional politicians, John Adams and Jimmy Carter share space for their \"Independent Cast of Mind,\" and Theodore Roosevelt and Richard Nixon are noted for \"Expanding Power.\" For anyone interested in the presidency, politics, or history The American President is a wonderful library addition.

He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a self-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands in 1947. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between apparently separate cultures. He is the author of another important text, Aku-Aku, this time focusing on the secrets and mysteries of Easter Island. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. Heyerdahl subsequently made other voyages designed to demonstrate the possibility of contact between widely separated ancient peoples. He was appointed a government scholar in 1984. In May 2011, the Thor Heyerdahl Archives were added to UNESCO's \"Memory of the World\" Register. At the time, this list included 238 collections from all over the world. The Heyerdahl Archives span the years 1937 to 2002 and include his photographic collection, diaries, private letters, expedition plans, articles, newspaper clippings, original book and article manuscripts. The Heyerdahl Archives are administered by the Kon-Tiki Museum and the National Library of Norway in Oslo.";31;NULL;2

43;Yamamoto Masao: Tori;Masao, Yamamoto;2017;Hardcover;Radius Books;Masao, Yamamoto;New;700;Aaron's Place;Photography, Art, Japanese;2.82;160;9;The master of the silent moment trains his lens on his lifelong obsession: birds  As a small boy growing up in the Japanese countryside, photographer Masao Yamamoto enjoyed looking up at the sky. From his classroom window, he would gaze at the windblown clouds, mesmerized by airborne creatures such as birds, butterflies and winged insects. He sometimes dreamed of riding on the back of a bird and flying away to faraway places.  Yamamoto’s career as a photographer began in 1993. One of Japan’s most important living photographers, Yamamoto has taken many different approaches to photography over the past 20 years. But what has remained constant is the artist’s belief that humans are just a small part of nature, united with it and part of it. Throughout his career, Yamamoto has often returned to animals, particularly birds, as a subject, reflecting his childhood fascination with the creatures and his eternal commitment to the unity of humanity and nature. With Tori, the photographer departs on yet another artistic journey, with a new series of quietly moving animal images (tori means “bird” in Japanese). Yamamoto asks himself, and his viewers: What do we see, and what do we identify with, in birds?;43;Limited edition signed by the photographer in japanese caligraphy.;2

Today, a number of these sturdy, beautifully proportioned barns and bridges are still standing — monuments to the skill and keen eye of their original builders. This lovingly written book, accompanied by more than 75 of the author's own sketches, provides a reliable record of those vanishing forms of architecture. Accurate line drawings depict a variety of barns, such as those in Maine, attached to houses\\; an \"open\" log barn in Virginia, and a \"top hat\" barn in North Carolina. Covered bridges — like barns, built for soundness and endurance — are also illustrated, among them a saltbox structure in New England, a bridge with a pedestrian walkway in rural New York State, and a 10-span-long bridge at Clark's Ferry, Pennsylvania. Possessing a deep feeling for what might be called the Age of Wood, the author writes with \"warmth and astonishing comprehension.\" — New York Herald Tribune Book Review.

Eighty-five of the works are from European schools—Italian, Flemish, Dutch, German, Spanish, British—ranging in time from an Epiphany by Giotto to Picasso's portrait of Gertrude Stein. The rest are American paintings, beginning with canvases by Pratt, Copley, and Stuart, continuing with Sargent, Homer, and Eakins, and concluding with a work by Morris Louis, painted in 1961. Long-time favorites are here (Bruegel's The Harvesters, El Greco's View of Toledo, Veronese's Mars and Venus United by Love, Watteau's Mezzetin) as well as extraordinary recent accessions (Rembrandt's Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer, La Tour's Fortune Teller, Monet's Terrace at Sainte-Adresse). Each reproduction is accompanied by comment on the painting's origin and significance. Expressly written for this book, these comments are the work of two of the Museum's experienced writers, Edith A. Standen and Thomas M. Folds. Introducing the publication, Claus Virch, Curator of European Paintings, gently warns persons who may unconsciously, through conditioning in our world of superabundant illustrations, settle for a color reproduction in place of the real thing. A book such as this, he notes, first of all hopes to prepare its \"readers\" for confrontations with the actual paintings. Second, it hopes to guide or refresh memories of the actual paintings. The aptness here of such reminders is partly a tribute to the care with which the hundred reproductions have been color-corrected and seen through the press. The book should appeal to a wide range of readers, both as a splendid sample of the Metropolitan's paintings collections and a stirring reminder of great achievements in art across a span of nearly seven centuries.";68;N/A;2

This is the first book that reveals how the Communists in China are utilizing this combination of misapplied psychology and perverted evangelism to make the Chinese impervious to all but the \"straight party line.\" It is George Orwell's 1984 brought to life -- a strange, distorted world that even Robinson Crusoe is condemned because of poor Crusoe's reliance on individual initiative. Mr. Hunter's account of this vicious technique is specific as well as general: A student tells how his brains were \"washed\" in a communist indoctrination school\\; another awakens from hypnotic control just in time to save his family\\; other chapters deal with the all-pervading campaign of hatred in Red China, directed particularly against America.

(Yes, opium.) Not to mention ear trumpets, horse buggies, and Bibles. The 1897 Sears, Roebuck & Co. Catalogue is both a wonderfully fascinating collector's item and a valuable piece of American history. For every recognizable item included, there are plenty of others guaranteed to confuse or interest 21st century readerslike Bust Cream or Food and Sweet Spirits of Nitre. What was once standard household fare is today a sometimes strange, often funny look at what life was once like for the average American family. It's amazing to see that a Princely Shirt for Princely Men cost $0.95 or three for $2.75 or that a Complete Violin Outfit (with bow and case) cost only $2.00.;137;NULL;2

At Dr. Billy Graham's suggestion, Dr. Schwarz formed the United States Christian Anti-Communism Crusade (CACC). For the next four decades, the CACC was the steel spine of the American anti-Communist movement, helping to educate such great anti-Communist leaders as Ronald Reagan.

Credited with \"doing gallant service, preserving records of the ways and the means of the forefathers who got along well with the resources now long forgotten\" (Springfield Republican), Eric Sloane has written an immensely enjoyable book that will enchant anyone who takes pleasure in reading about the past and views its artifacts as part of a rich national heritage.";164;NULL;2

It saw Lincoln's assassination just five days later and a near-successful plot to decapitate the Union government, followed by chaos and coup fears in the North, collapsed negotiations and continued bloodshed in the South, and finally, the start of national reconciliation.  In the end, April 1865 emerged as not just the tale of the war's denouement, but the story of the making of our nation.  Jay Winik offers a brilliant new look at the Civil War's final days that will forever change the way we see the war's end and the nation's new beginning. Uniquely set within the larger sweep of history and filled with rich profiles of outsize figures, fresh iconoclastic scholarship, and a gripping narrative, this is a masterful account of the thirty most pivotal days in the life of the United States.;176;First Edition. ;2

Libertine, brawler, thief, scholar, rake, murderer, Villon was a citizen of Paris and a lover of its teeming streets, the sounds and sights of which fill his works: \"The Legacy\", \"The Testament\", \"Miscellaneous Poems\", and \"Poems in Slang\". The works of the man who has been called the key figure in modern poetry are presented here in a fresh, free-verse English translation as well as in the original French. The design of the book is such that the French text and the English translation face each other on opposite pages, line for line, verse for verse. Along with the brilliant introduction by William Carlos Williams, the volume contains a short biography of Villon, a foreword concerning the text, translation, and notes, as well as a bibliography and an index of first lines, both in French and in English.";301;NULL;2

342;Gig: Americans Talk About Their Jobs;"Bowe, John (Editor)\\; Bowe, Marisa (Editor)\\; Streeter, Sabin C. (Editor)\\; Kernochan, Rose (Editor)";2001;Softcover;Three Rivers;NULL;Like New;15;Aaron's Place;Social-Science;1.25;688;9;This wide-ranging survey of the American economy at the turn of the millennium is stunning, surprising, and always entertaining. It gives us an unflinching view of the fabric of this country from the point of view of the people who keep it all moving. The more than 120 roughly textured monologues that make up Gig beautifully capture the voices of our fast-paced and diverse economy. The selections demonstrate how much our world has changed--and stayed the same--in the three decades prior to the turn of the millennium. If you think things have speeded up, become more complicated and more technological, you're right.  But people's attitudes about their jobs, their hopes and goals and disappointments, endure. Gig's soul isn't sociological--it's emotional. The wholehearted diligence that people bring to their work is deeply, inexplicably moving. People speak in these pages of the constant and complex stresses nearly all of them confront on the job, but, nearly universally, they throw themselves without reservation into coping with them. Instead of resisting work, we seem to adapt to it. Some of us love our jobs, some of us don't, but almost all of us are not quite sure what we would do without one.  With all the hallmarks of another classic on this subject, Gig is a fabulous read, filled with indelible voices from coast to coast. After hearing them, you'll never again feel quite the same about how we work.;342;Gift from Davide Agnelli;2

This work includes: chronological depiction of the fine arts from their origins in Rome through the late baroque and rococo\\; explanation of the socio-political background: the Counter-Reformation, the development of Protestantism, absolutism, and the French Revolution\\; and various ways the baroque left its mark, including city planning, architecture, garden design, sculpture, painting and emblems. During the baroque period, architecture and the other fine arts were the instruments of a staging of \"world theatre\" on a grand scale. The baroque art of the popes in Rome, the displays of power and opulence in the court of the Sun King, Louis XIV, and Dutch painting - they all reflect different aspects of the underlying tension between pleasure in life and fear of death that was such a prominent feature of the baroque world view. This volume portrays the entire span of the fine arts of the baroque era, from rich splendour to religious asceticism.";352;NULL;2

465;A High Wind in Jamaica;Hughes, Richard;1963;Softcover;Time;NULL;Good;10;Sycamore:;Novel;NULL;NULL;N;Richard Hughes's celebrated short novel is a masterpiece of concentrated narrative. Its dreamlike action begins among the decayed plantation houses and overwhelming natural abundance of late nineteenth-century Jamaica, before moving out onto the high seas, as Hughes tells the story of a group of children thrown upon the mercy of a crew of down-at-the-heel pirates. A tale of seduction and betrayal, of accommodation and manipulation, of weird humor and unforeseen violence, this classic of twentieth-century literature is above all an extraordinary reckoning with the secret reasons and otherworldly realities of childhood.;465;NULL;2

He faces Al Capone and his gang as well as all sorts of other villains. Hergé shows his generous vision of the world as he offers a very well documented depiction of the sad plight of the Native Americans. Tintin's fame extends beyond the Atlantic Ocean, so, when he arrives in Chicago in the middle of Prohibition, all the gangsters in the city have gathered to make sure that he gets the most uncomfortable reception. Tintin will need to use all his determination and intelligence to survive! Tintin in America is the highest-selling Tintin title of all time. It is the clear winner ahead of Tintin in the Congo and Explorers on the Moon, which come in second and third places respectively.;491;N/A;2

517;Constant Gardener, The;Le Carre, John;2004;Paperback;Scribner Book Company;NULL;Fair;5;Sycamore:;Novel;NULL;NULL;N;Tessa Quayle--young, beautiful, and dearly beloved to husband Justin--is gruesomely murdered in northern Kenya. When Justin sets out on a personal odyssey to uncover the mystery of her death, what he finds could make him not only a suspect, but also a target for Tessa's killers. A master chronicler of the betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, John le Carre portrays the dark side of unbridled capitalism as only he can. In The Constant Gardener he tells a compelling, complex story of a man elevated through tragedy, as Justin Quayle--amateur gardener, aging widower, and ineffectual bureaucrat--discovers his own natural resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love.;517;NULL;2

With stories of qualifying statements about evolution in public school textbooks and the recent 70th anniversary of the Scopes Monkey trial in the news, the question about our origins will not be put to rest.

As Wallace Stegner writes, [Clark's] theme was civilization, and he recorded, indelibly, its first steps in a new country.;641;NULL;2

Randy Shaw argues that they have, with destructive consequences for America. Since the 1970s, activist participation in national struggles has steadily given way to a nearly exclusive focus on local issues. America's political and corporate elite has succeeded in controlling the national agenda, while their adversaries—the citizen activists and organizations who spent decades building federal programs to reflect the country's progressive ideals—increasingly bypass national fights. The result has been not only the dismantling of hard-won federal programs but also the sabotaging of local agendas and community instituions by decisions made in the national arena.  Shaw urges activists and their organizations to implement a \"new national activism\" by channeling energy from closely knit local groups into broader causes. Such activism enables locally oriented activists to shape America's future and work on national fights without traveling to Washington, D.C., but instead working in their own backyards. Focusing on the David and Goliath struggle between Nike and grassroots activists critical of the company's overseas labor practices, Shaw shows how national activism can rewrite the supposedly ironclad rules of the global economy by ensuring fair wages and decent living standards for workers at home and abroad. Similarly, the recent struggles for stronger clean air standards and new federal budget priorities demonstrate the potential grassroots national activism to overcome the corporate and moneyed interests that increasingly dictate America's future.  Reclaiming America's final section describes how community-based nonprofit organizations, the media, and the Internet are critical resources for building national activism. Shaw declares that community-based groups can and must combine their service work with national grassroots advocacy. He also describes how activists can use public relations to win attention in today's sprawling media environment, and he details the movement-building potential of e-mail. All these resources are essential for activists and their organizations to reclaim America's progressive ideals.";672;NULL;2

What followed was the evolution and revolution of album cover art - Phonographics! Phonographics is a representative collection of the best work from the last decade. One hundred and fifty-eight full-color reproductions illustrate the incredible range and excitement of this burgeoning art form.

821;Sense of Being Stared At, The: And Other Unexplained Powers of the Human Mind;Sheldrake, Rupert;2003;Paperback;Three Rivers Press;NULL;Fair;5;Sycamore:;Science;NULL;NULL;N;Nearly everyone has experienced the feeling of being watched or had their stare result in a glance in their direction. The phenomenon has been cited throughout history in nearly every culture, along with other commonplace “paranormal” occurrences such as premonitions and telepathy.  In this newly updated edition, Sheldrake shares his more than 25 years of research into telepathy, the power of staring, remote viewing, precognition, and animal premonitions. Drawing on more than 5,000 case histories, 4,000 questionnaire responses, and the results of experiments on staring, thought transference, phone telepathy, and other phenomena carried out with more than 20,000 people as well as reports and data from dozens of independent research teams, Sheldrake shows that these unexplained human abilities--such as the sense of being stared at--are not paranormal but normal, part of our biological nature. He reveals that telepathy depends on social bonds and traces its evolution from the connections between members of animal groups such as flocks, schools, and packs. Sheldrake shows that our minds and intentions extend beyond our brains into our surroundings with invisible connections that link us to each other, to the world around us, and even to the future.;821;NULL;2
710;Rediscovering the Golden State : California Geography;Selby, William A.;2000;Paperback;John Wiley & Sons;NULL;Fair ;50;Sycamore:;Geography, California;NULL;NULL;N;Rediscovering the Golden State: California Geography examines this unique state’s incredibly diverse landscapes, and how geography and geographic change influences everything from the state’s natural systems and cycles, to its agriculture and more advanced industries, to human migration, cultures, and urban planning. Exploring California through a geographic lens reveals how the field has evolved to cross traditional boundaries, connect local and global issues, and provide the insights that lead to practical solutions to problems new and old. Challenging the reader to look beyond stereotypes and assumptions, this book encourages active participation in planning the state’s dynamic future. And this project makes teaching and learning about the geography of California more convenient, exciting, and rewarding for instructors and students.  Going beyond a scientific analysis of natural features and environmental processes, this book illustrates how social, political, and economic divides can be bridged through the study of geography and the connections it brings to light. From geology, weather and climate, biogeography, and hydrology, we cover the state’s physical geography. And from demography and migration, to cultures and economies, to rural and urban geography, we monitor the state’s human geography pulse and then make the vital connections. California continues to lead the nation in population, economics (5th largest in the world), agriculture, natural and cultural diversity, and a host of other categories. This powerful state has earned this powerful publication. This timely and versatile book will prove useful to Californians in business, education, government, and to concerned citizens and curious readers seeking to learn more about the Golden State.;710;NULL;2

The whimsical, sometimes melancholy stories, which often use nonsense language,[1] were originally created for his own daughters. Sandburg had three daughters, Margaret, Janet and Helga, whom he nicknamed \"Spink\", \"Skabootch\" and \"Swipes\" -those nicknames occur in some of his Rootabaga stories. The \"Rootabaga\" stories were born of Sandburg's desire for \"American fairy tales\" to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so set his stories in a fictionalized American Midwest called \"the Rootabaga country\" filled with farms, trains, and corn fairies. A large number of the stories are told by the Potato Face Blind Man, an old minstrel of the Village of Liver-and-Onions who hangs out in front of the local post office.";767;Jacket clipped.;2

As the revolutionary democrats begin to rise in Russia, different ideologies begin to collide. Dostoevsky casts a critical eye on both the left-wing idealists, exposing their ideas and ideological foundation as demonic, and the conservative establishment's ineptitude in dealing with those ideas and their social consequences. This form of intellectual conservativism tied to the Slavophil movement of Dostoevsky's day, is seen to have continued on into its modern manifestation in individuals like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Dostoevsky's novels focusing on the idea that utopias and positivist ideas, in being utilitarian, were unrealistic and unobtainable. The book has five primary ideological characters: Verkhovensky, Shatov, Stavrogin, Stepan Trofimovich, and Kirilov. Through their philosophies, Dostoevsky describes the political chaos seen in 19th-Century Russia.;790;Sandglass missing.;2

Later followed by Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Story of a Bad Boy--once called the first truly American novel--is Aldrich’s partially autobiographical tale of growing up in America. Set in Rivermouth (based on Aldrich’s childhood home in Portsmouth, New Hampshire), it follows the exploits of young Tom Bailey through snowball wars, schoolyard fights, Fourth of July parades, adventures at sea, and childhood sweathearts. Now printed in more than fifty editions and read and beloved by Americans for over a century, Aldrich’s classic is ready to be rediscovered by a new generation of readers.;795;NULL;2

From the moment he caught the public's eye in the early 1980s as the iconic front man of the Smiths, and through his subsequent solo career, the patron saint of misfits has fascinated and baffled in equal measure.Yet, as Mark Simpson argues in this wickedly funny and deeply sacrilegious psycho-bio -- told through the lens of his own obsession as a lifelong fan -- Morrissey isn't quite so enigmatic as he might appear. To understand this most private (and sexually ambivalent) of stars, one need only uncover the countless clues to his personality in his startlingly candid song lyrics and his innumerable provocative interviews. Simpson deftly explores why Morrissey bewitched a generation -- and why he remains as intriguing as ever. In fact 2004 was Morrissey's best year to date, bringing his biggest-selling album, a sold-out tour, and the adulation of legions of new fans. Both an insightful look at the singer's career and a personal story of a boy's first love for his music idol, Saint Morrissey is, like its subject, shrewd, sharp-witted, charming, and utterly original.;804;First Edition.;2

On every page surprises leap out to delight readers. Crickets chirp, ostriches flap their wings, and blue-footed boobies dance in an endless mating ritual. There are tabs to pull, flaps to flip, and details to ponder. The text, which is basic at best, discusses ways in which mammals, fish, and birds entice, frighten, and fool each other. However, visually this book is so appealing that its point is well made. It should encourage more detailed exploration and reading by students, so this fun-filled volume is a worthy addition to nature sections. Dinosaurs is so clever and exciting that serious consideration should be given to its purchase. It's a truly three-dimensional work in which dinosaurs leap out at the turn of a page\\; icthyornis fly through the air\\; bone heads do battle at the tug of a tab. Turn a flap and a baby dinosaur pops out of an egg while a less fortunate hatchling is stolen by a lizard. The text describes most major dinosaurs as well as some that are lesser known.

851;"Struggles And Triumphs\\; Or, Forty Years' Recollections of P. T. Barnum";Barnum, P. T.;1874;Hardcover;Warren, Johnson & Co, Buffalo;NULL;Fair ;80;Sycamore: Top;Biography & Essays;NULL;NULL;N;Phineas Taylor Barnum, popularly known as P.T. Barnum, released his own biography in 1855, titled The Life of P.T. Barnum, which includes his golden rules for money-making.  This edition is a 1888 reprint, containing essentially the same account as the original and includes a number of images and illustrations.  This volume can be well regarded as a manual of showmanship and moneymaking, given the notorious American businessman's trade and success in his chosen profession. It is quite ironic that someone who is, at the core, sort of a coward and averse to certain inconveniences, would make his stamp in history and society as a master in frauds and hoaxes via his famed Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.  The book also displays the author's eccentricity and coarseness, as well as near-sociopathic inclinations in full splendor. As such it is an amusing read, albeit long winded at times. However, the small text may challenge one's vision and makes this tome quite lengthy.  What's most interesting about this autobiography is that it is not wholly an account of the author's life. It also has self-help elements that make this book double as a marketing and racketeering manual, as earlier mentioned.  Those who admire Barnum's legacy, as well as those looking to be entertained by real life experiences of a historical figure of an intriguing reputation will do well to pick up this book.;851;NULL;2

In Shardik Adams sets a different yet equally compelling tale in a far-off fantasy world.

Mighty, ferocious, and unpredictable, Shardik changes the life of every person in the story. His advent commences a momentous chain of events. Kelderek the hunter, who loves and trusts the great bear, is swept up by destiny to become first devotee and then prophet, then victorious soldier, then ruler of an empire and priest-king of Lord Shardik―Messenger of God―only to discover ever-deeper layers of meaning implicit in his passionate belief in the bear’s divinity.;875;NULL;2

Following an encounter with the former Helen of Troy (now returned to her husband, the king of Sparta, after the ignominious defeat of the Trojans), Odysseus gradually wends his way to Egypt and southward, grappling all the while with questions about the nature of God. Considered by Kazantzakis himself to be one of his most important works, The Odyssey takes readers on a richly imagined quest for adventure and understanding with one of literature’s most timeless characters.;910;Jacket clipping inside.;2

Modestine, Stevenson’s much-adored but predictably stubborn donkey, sets the pace and becomes a central character in the account of this twelve-day adventure. Beguiling and charming, this pioneering travelogue lends itself beautifully to Stevenson’s dry humor and razor-sharp reflections. Thought by many to be a slender but influential masterpiece of early travel writing, it ranks on The Guardian’s list of one hundred best nonfiction books of all time.

The references to love, matrinmonial fidelity, and desire for progeny are understandable in an ensemble that might have celebrated a marriage. But the unicorn, at the same time, is Christ, and the compositions reflect the Incarnation, the Passion, and the Resurrection. Gabriel, the angel of the Annunciation, is one of the hunters: the unicorn loses his fierceness in the lap of the Virgin Mary\\; a thorny crown encircles his horn and neck when he is slain\\; and then the glorious creature is miraculously alive again and chained to a pomegranate tree, simultaneously an image of the risen Christ and of the lover-bridegroom secured by his adored lady.";979;"\"For Mindy from Dad and Mom, Christmas 1976\" written inside.

And it is to be guided among all the myriad marvels of the earth by an eloquent commentator, backed by the prodigious resources of a great institution- the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. This extraordinary museum, which attracts five million visitors a year, is a repository of wonders beyond counting and almost beyond description. it contains specimens of virtually every plant and animal- extant or extinct- ever seen on earth. The earliest fossil known to man is here, and the oldest rock yet found. There's a flying reptile with a 40-foot wingspan and the world's one remaining \"dragon.\" The legendary Hope Diamond is here, and the hide of General Pershing's horse. There are rocks drilled clear through by lightning and iridescent butterflies whose colorless wings refract light like prisms.

Designer and illustrator Christoph Niemann was inspired to create a series of miniature New York vignettes out of his sons' toys after a few cold and dark winter days in Berlin. The former New Yorker then posted photographs of his creations along with his handwritten captions on his New York Times blog. Resident and honorary New Yorkers around the world responded enthusiastically to the clever and minimalist inventions, which captured both the iconic (the Empire State Building) and the mundane (man standing on a subway platform) in fewer LEGO pieces than one might think possible. This book includes all of the original images, plus thirteen new creations. The resulting collection is delightful in its simplicity and moving in its ability to cature the spirit of life in New York in so few strokes.;1052;NULL;2

Ryoji Ikeda and Carsten Nicolai both work at the cutting-edge of contemporary electronic music and sound art. In 1999, the two artists initiated the joint project cyclo., which is devoted to the visualization of sound. In their shared work, they generate new hybrid forms of audiovisual art and expand the possibilities of digital technology. The project’s first publication is cylco. id, a book and included CD-ROM that offer a multimedia and interactive documentation of the audiovisual material that Nicolai and Ikeda have collected, researched, and created since they began working together. The featured images are formed by the metering of sound bits that have been selected by the artists with meticulous care according to their acoustic and illustrative potential. The material collected in cyclo. id is pure elegance, and its rich structural complexity is inspiring for anyone working with sounds and forms. Visually fascinating, the examples also invite the viewer to play and experiment with them. The open-source format of the digital files makes it easy for creatives to further develop the data and use them in their own work. Carsten Nicolai, the renowned German contemporary artist who successfully documented fundamental visual structures in Grid Index and Moiré Index, has been working at the intersection of art and science since the early 1990s. The work of Ryoji Ikeda, one of Japan’s leading electronic composers, explores the physical properties of sound.;1054;NULL;2

Impressed by the simplicity of these images, Stephenson began to photograph birds. His first subjects belonged to the treasurer of the UK Budgie Society, who deemed his portraits \"crap\" because he had omitted the legs and tails. He subsequently developed an eye for the nuances of bird photography, and, making a specialty of photographing show birds of all kinds, developed the body of work gathered in this volume. While Stephenson's photographs depict these birds with apparent neutrality (against a variety of colored backgrounds), Michael Smith observes in his foreword to this volume that \"they live in an overlap between the natural and manmade worlds, and say as much about the culture that created them as they do about nature.";1056;Cute little book with photos of show birds.;2

In it, Franchi also envisions the future of news reporting by publishing companies and on the internet. Francesco Franchi is one of the most exceptional talents working in information graphics today. Although relatively young and new to the field, Franchi has already received worldwide acclaim for his distinctive graphic and Edited byial design of IL--Intelligence in Lifestyle, an Italian magazine now widely considered to be a modern classic. With Designing News, Franchi conveys his vision for the future of news and the media industry. Based on personal insight and experience, he offers valuable analysis and perspectives on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the way media is being used. Franchi explores consumer behaviors and expectations that represent the biggest challenges facing traditional publishing houses and broadcasting companies as well as journalists and designers. For Franchi, reporting is not merely filing a story once, but rather telling a continuous narrative in a way that is most relevant for a broad range of traditional and digital media--from breaking news to analysis, from interviews to commentaries, and from photo essays and illustrations to information graphics and interactive visualizations of data. In this book, Franchi explains the ramifications of this development and how newspapers can become credible, comprehensive news brands. In Designing News, Franchi also outlines a new, integrated approach for Edited byial designers. If they show enough dedication, creativity, and talent for interdisciplinary teamwork, Franchi sees Edited byial designers as playing a key role in advancing the evolution of media.;1062;NULL;2

He called his style of painting \"minimal realism. . . . Instead of trying to put everything in when I paint, I try to leave everything out. . . . I reduce the subject to the simplest possible visual terms without losing identity, thereby enhancing identity.\" Harper's approach to depicting the natural world is both sophisticated and fun.

The Floating Piers (English and Italian Edition);Volz, Wolfgang & Jonathan William Henery;2016;Paperback;Taschen;Christo and Jeanne-Claude;Good;20;Aaron & Tina's;Art, Fine-Art;NULL;NULL;N;" From June 18 to July 3, 2016, 100 kilometers east of Milan and 200 kilometers west of Venice, thousands of people will walk on water. The Floating Piers by Christo and Jeanne-Claude deploys 70,000 square meters of shimmering yellow fabric above a modular floating dock system of 220,000 high-density polyethylene cubes to create a temporary three-kilometer walkway across the surface of Lake Iseo, connecting the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Paolo.  The piers are 16 meters wide and approximately 40 centimeters high, with sloping sides. Visitors experience the artwork by walking from Sulzano to Monte Isola and over to San Paolo. The mountains surrounding the lake also offer a bird’s-eye view of the project, revealing unnoticed angles and perspectives.  The Floating Piers is Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s first large-scale project since they realized The Gates in 2005 and draws upon their established history of projects in Italy, including Wrapped Fountain and Wrapped Medieval Tower in Spoleto, 1968\\; Wrapped Monuments in Milan, 1970\\; and The Wall – Wrapped Roman Wall in Rome, 1973–74. As with all of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s projects, The Floating Piers is funded entirely through the sale of Christo’s original works of art. After the 16-day exhibition, all components will be removed and recycled.  This book presents rich photographic coverage of The Floating Piers alongside sketches, models, documents and designs, revealing the process behind this waterborne work of art. Incorporating everything from approval procedures to the manufacture of fabric and anchoring elements, it testifies not only to Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s unique creative imagination but also to the immense technical, bureaucratic, and logistical feats that allowed the concept to take float.";1067;NULL;2

Seen from the buildings surrounding the park, The Gates will look like a golden, flowing river, while those walking through them will experience the ambience of a fluid, golden ceiling. The temporary work of art will remain in place for 16 days, after which it will be disassembled and the materials recycled. The installation will be free for all visitors, who can continue to use Central Park undisturbed during the whole process. This historic event is intended to provide a memorable and joyous experience for every New Yorker, and TASCHEN will document this project from start to finish in two editions.;1068;NULL;2

Defying definitions of genre, Doug Aitken has explored every medium, from architecture and film to installations and interventions. While Aitken’s work varies in both theme and context, his installations share a common thread in their ability to use technology to evoke meaningful personal reactions from the viewer, encourage audience interaction, and inspire communal gatherings. His films often explore themes of displacement and temporality, and through his keen awareness of motion, sound, and color he creates dreamlike landscapes and the futurist aesthetic for which he has become known. This beautifully designed book features visual essays by the artist and surveys his work in all mediums. The monograph is organized thematically into the four most prevalent ideas connected with his work, inspires thought, and will leave readers examining their own relationship to the world around them.;1338;NULL;2

For over four decades, Weiner has defined art as a representation of relationships in the physical world—“the relationship of human beings to objects and objects to objects in relation to human beings.” This highly anticipated publication represents the full range of Weiner’s practice, from the early 1960s to the present, from his early paintings to his work in language, including works on paper, films, videos, books, and public commissions. Weiner adopted language as his primary material in 1968. According to his landmark STATEMENT OF INTENT, an oft-quoted declaration first published in 1969, each work can be constructed by the artist, fabricated by someone else, or need not be built at all and simply presented in language. Weiner’s work is often manifested outside the gallery context—through postcards, billboards, lectures, or even on a series of cast-iron manhole covers for the city of New York.This substantial publication, produced in conjunction with the artist’s first major retrospective in the United States and in close collaboration with the artist, constitutes Weiner’s largest monograph to date and brings together five esteemed scholars along with Turner Prize finalist Liam Gillick to examine the artist’s impact on the art world today.;1349;NULL;2

It is an established tool that is used by print and web designers to create well-structured, balanced designs. Rudimentary versions of grid systems existed since the medieval times, but a group of Swiss graphic designers, mostly inspired in ideas from typographical literature started building a more rigid and coherent system for page layout. The core of these ideas were first presented by Müller-Brockmann who helped to spread the knowledge about the grids thorough the world. This volume provides guidelines and rules for the function and use for grid systems from 8 to 32 grid fields which can be used for the most varied of projects, the three-dimensional grid being treated as well. Exact directions for using all of the grid systems possibe presented are given to the user, showing examples of working correctly on a conceptual level.;1355;NULL;2

The Rise of David Bowie, 1972-1973;Hoskyns, Barney;2016;Hardcover;Taschen;Rock, Mick;Used;100;Anne & Matt;Music, Photography;6.48;300;9;A unique tribute from David Bowie's official photographer and creative partner, Mick Rock, compiled in 2015, with Bowie's blessing.In 1972, David Bowie released his groundbreaking album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. With it landed Bowie's Stardust alter ego: a glitter-clad, mascara-eyed, sexually ambiguous persona who kicked down the boundaries between male and female, straight and gay, fact and fiction into one shifting and sparkling phenomenon of '70s self-expression. Together, Ziggy the album and Ziggy the stage spectacular propelled the softly spoken Londoner into one of the world's biggest stars.A key passenger on this glam trip into the stratosphere was fellow Londoner and photographer Mick Rock. Rock bonded with Bowie artistically and personally, immersed himself in the singer's inner circle, and, between 1972 and 1973, worked as the singer's photographer and videographer.This collection brings together spectacular stage shots, iconic photo shoots, as well as intimate backstage portraits. It celebrates Bowie's fearless experimentation and reinvention, while offering privileged access to the many facets of his personality and fame. Through the aloof and approachable, the playful and serious, the candid and the contrived, the result is a passionate tribute to a brilliant and inspirational artist whose creative vision will never be forgotten.;1373;NULL;2

1381;How to See: Visual Adventures in a World God Never Made;Nelson, George;2017;Hardcover;Phaidon;Bierut, Michael;Like New;30;Aaron & Tina's;Design, Theory, Culture;2.8;248;9;George Nelson was one the most influential forces in modern design in the 20th century. He became Herman Miller's design director in the '40s and introduced designers such as the Eameses, Noguchi, and Girard to the public. His signature lamps, benches, clocks, couches, and storage systems have become internationally recognized icons. He also wrote and lectured extensively. This book, How to see, originally published in 1977, was a seminal work for professional designers and students across many disciplines at that time. More than a guide to visual appreciation, this is a book about how to recognize, evaluate, and understand the objects and landscape of the man-made world. The pursuit of design is not about the way things appear, but rather about the way things give meaning and relevance to the human experience. This reedition, updated and in color, should further establish Nelson's influence in design, as well as introduce the art of seeing to a broader audience.;1381;NULL;2

Drawing upon hundreds of letters, diaries, memoirs, and journals as well as the latest scholarship, THE WEST chronicles the arrival of wave after wave of newcomers from every direction of the compass. The cast is as rich and diverse as the western landscape itself--explorers, soldiers, Indian warriors, settlers, railroad builders and gaudy showmen.

So are scores of lesser-known westerners whose stories are no less compelling--a Chinese ditchdigger. a rich Mexican landowner, a forty-niner from Chile, a Texas cowboy born in Britain, a woman missionary to the Indians who loathed the West and a Wellesley graduate who loved it in spite of everything it did to her and her family. It is the central story of America, a story filled with heroism and hope, enterprise and adventure as well as tragedy and disappointment. THE WEST explores the tensions between whites and the native peoples they sought to displace, but it also encompasses the Hispanic experience in the West from the time of the conquistadors to the transformation of a Mexican-American village called Los Angeles into the region's major metropolis, the lives of Chinese immigrants who called the region \"Gold Mountain\", and the ordeals of freed slaves from the South who sought a better life homesteading on the Great Plains.

Far from the glamorous and avant-garde architectural features that make Los Angeles justifiably famous are the humble apartment buildings known as \"dingbats.\" But Pretty Vacant dares to elevate the low-rise, the boxy, the not remarkably well-constructed to the architecturally sublime. In this inexpensive brick of a book, through scads of photographs of these underappreciated gems, their boundless surfacey charms are soon obvious. Combining funky textures, streamlined sconces, and future-retro ornamentation, these buildings practically define LA vernacular in their optimistic mix of mid-century modishness and darling details. Clive Piercy's photographs provide a streetside glimpse into the curious lives of these buildings, with charming names that range from the regal (Kings Studios) to the space-age (The Galaxie).

Even the development and protection of nature in the countryside are undertaken in service of city dwellers, so that they can experience scenic beauty as a compensation for the pernicious urban life. Oase No. 63 questions existing approaches which view the countryside as the empty or “negative” part of the contemporary urban condition, and consequently reduce the countryside to what remains after the positive urban shape has been thought or carved out. Here the perspective is reversed: neither the city nor urbanization but rather the countryside and the agrarian industry constitute the starting point of this study. Thus Oase No. 63 asks: Is it be possible to consider an alternative future for the countryside based on its intrinsic qualities? To what degree is the countryside capable of absorbing contemporary practices and processes? Does the countryside count at all as a bearer of political economy?;1417;NULL;2

Fascinated by what drives us and makes us feel alive, Crawford says: \"When I look at making spaces, I don’t just look at the visual.

Many of Baldessari's prints series have been extremely influential, such as the 1970s Raw Prints series, for which he amended photos of Santa Monica mallgoers with abstracted shapes printed above the images that replicate details from them\\; this series was pivotal in democratizing photo-based prints in the art world. Since then, Baldessari has gone on to collaborate with some of the world's great printmakers, such as Brooke Alexander, Gemini G.E.L., Cirrus Editions, Edition Jacob Samuel, Mixographia and Crown Point Press. An essential volume in any contemporary art library, this first full survey of Baldessari's four-decade printmaking career is the definitive volume on the prints, and boasts 140 color plates alongside testimonies from his printmaking collaborators.";1443;NULL;2

Influenced by a confluence of humanism, colonialism, and racism, this mythology ignored local wisdom and indigenous innovation, deeming it primitive. Today, we have slowly come to realize that the legacy of this mythology is haunting us.  Designers understand the urgency of reducing humanity’s negative environmental impact, yet perpetuate the same mythology of technology that relies on exploiting nature. Responding to climate change by building hard infrastructures and favoring high-tech homogenous design, we are ignoring millennia-old knowledge of how to live in symbiosis with nature. Without implementing soft systems that use biodiversity as a building block, designs remain inherently unsustainable.  Lo—TEK, derived from Traditional Ecological Knowledge, is a cumulative body of multigenerational knowledge, practices, and beliefs, countering the idea that indigenous innovation is primitive and exists isolated from technology. It is sophisticated and designed to sustainably work with complex ecosystems.;1459;NULL;2

But its influence stretched--and stretches--far beyond its modest distribution and print runs of the time. Indeed, for many graphic designers, Typographica is something of an obsession, to be collected if and when found, savored, and poured over for designs and techniques not seen since.Remarkably, Spencer never intended to turn a profit, so no expenses were spared in the making of the magazine. Different papers, letterpress, tip-ins, and more were all employed in the presentation of an eclectic range of subject matter: Braille, locomotive lettering, sex and typography, typewriter faces, street lettering, matches, and avant-garde poetry all found their way into the magazine.Rick Poynor, founding editor of Eye, recreates the excitement of Typographica in this carefully researched, accessibly written, and beautifully illustrated book that pays tribute to the man and the magazine that changed the course of graphic design.;1474;an archieve of old Typographica Magazine;2

Maps of physical spaces locate us in the world and help us navigate unfamiliar routes. Maps of topical spaces help us visualize the extent and structure of our collective knowledge\\; they reveal bursts of activity, pathways of ideas, and borders that beg to be crossed. This book, from the author of Atlas of Science, describes the power of topical maps, providing readers with principles for visualizing knowledge and offering as examples forty large-scale and more than 100 small-scale full-color maps.  Today, data literacy is becoming as important as language literacy. Well-designed visualizations can rescue us from a sea of data, helping us to make sense of information, connect ideas, and make better decisions in real time. In Atlas of Knowledge, leading visualization expert Katy Börner makes the case for a systems science approach to science and technology studies and explains different types and levels of analysis. Drawing on fifteen years of teaching and tool development, she introduces a theoretical framework meant to guide readers through user and task analysis\\; data preparation, analysis, and visualization\\; visualization deployment\\; and the interpretation of science maps. To exemplify the framework, the Atlas features striking and enlightening new maps from the popular “Places & Spaces: Mapping Science” exhibit that range from “Key Events in the Development of the Video Tape Recorder” to “Mobile Landscapes: Location Data from Cell Phones for Urban Analysis” to “Literary Empires: Mapping Temporal and Spatial Settings of Victorian Poetry” to “Seeing Standards: A Visualization of the Metadata Universe.” She also discusses the possible effect of science maps on the practice of science.";1496;NULL;2

Originally published as a boxed set by Doubleday in 1970, the book was accompanied by large graphic posters that could serve as a portable learning environment for a new process-based model of education, and a bibliography and checklist that map patterns and relationships between radical thought and artistic practices―from the modernist avant-gardes to postmodernism, from the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, from Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin to Buckminster Fuller and Norman O. Brown―with Herbert Marcuse and Marshall McLuhan serving as points of anchorage. Blueprint for Counter Education thus serves as a vital synthesis of the numerous intellectual currents in the countercultural debate on the radical reform of schools, universities and ways of learning. To accompany this new facsimile edition of the book and posters, an 80-page booklet features a conversation with the original Blueprint creators, Maurice R.

Over the course of his long career, Picasso devoted himself to sculpture wholeheartedly, if episodically, using both traditional and unconventional materials and techniques. Unlike painting, in which he was formally trained and through which he made his living, sculpture occupied a uniquely personal and experimental status in Picasso's oeuvre. He kept the majority of his sculptures in his private possession during his lifetime, and it was only in the late 1960s that the public became fully aware of this side of his oeuvre. Picasso Sculpture presents approximately 150 sculptures--many of them captured in newly commissioned and sometimes multi-view photographs--alongside a selection of works on paper and photographs.;1523;by Luise Mahler (Author), Virginie Perdrisot (Author), Rebecca Lowery (Author), Ann Temkin (Editor), Anne Umland (Editor), Pablo Picasso (Artist);2
1524;They Called Her Styrene, Etc.;Ruscha, Ed;2000;Hardcover;Phaidon;Ruscha, Ed;Good;40;Aaron & Tina's;Art, Fine-Art, Typography, Graphic Design;2.29;580;9;Los Angeles-based artist Ed Ruscha, one of the seminal American artists of the past 30 years, is known for taking elements from the visual language of advertising and commercial art: he has made hundreds of 'word' prints, drawings and paintings that exhibit an interplay between bold letters and softly shaded, atmospheric backgrounds.  This book reproduces close to 600 'word' artworks by Ruscha, all of which characterize his artistic scope and identity. Assembled together in the form of a thick block, making the book and art 'object' in itself, these images become a sort of novel without an obvious plot: a series of words with no narrative but, rather, with a life of their own. Some of the works consist of only one word - great, mud, trust - and others of short combinations or phrases, such as Indeed I do, She Sure Knew Her Devotionals, Your Polyester People, That Housing Tract is Only Texture, and, of course, They Called Her Styrene.  In these works Ruscha's words transcend their apparent randomness to become visual icons of universal emotions and places known and imagined, exposing a dimension of multi-layered irony and threads of subtle and inventive social commentary. This volume embodies an aesthetically appealing compilation presented, in the manner of its content, with bold flair and bright colours: a book that simply cannot be left alone.;1524;NULL;2

In the early 1990s, just prior to his immersion in the scene around New York's Alleged Gallery, Campbell would regularly hole up in the North African enclave to produce paintings for solo exhibitions in Paris, New York and Rabat, all the while scouring the coast during the winter months for whatever waves might roll in from the Atlantic. Later, over the last ten years, Campbell brought various surfers of note (such as Dan Malloy, Alex Knost, Craig Anderson, Dave Rastovich and Ryan Burch) to join him there, and to savor Morocco's glorious climate and stupendous surf. This book, the second in Campbell's Slide surfing series (following 2012's Slide Your Brains Out), records these collective Moroccan adventures from the past 20 years, in color and black-and-white images that range from the everyday to the sublime.;1526;NULL;2

In his modern classics One Man’s Owl and Mind of the Raven, Bernd Heinrich has written memorably about his relationships with wild ravens and a great horned owl. In One Wild Bird at a Time, Heinrich returns to his great love: close, day-to-day observations of individual wild birds.   There are countless books on bird behavior, but Heinrich argues that some of the most amazing bird behaviors fall below the radar of what most birds do in aggregate. Heinrich’s “passionate observations [that] superbly mix memoir and science” lead to fascinating questions—and sometimes startling discoveries (The New York Times Book Review). A great crested flycatcher, while bringing food to the young in their nest, is attacked by the other flycatcher nearby. Why? A pair of Northern flickers hammering their nest-hole into the side of Heinrich’s cabin deliver the opportunity to observe the feeding competition between siblings, and to make a related discovery about nest-cleaning. One of a clutch of redstart warbler babies fledges out of the nest from twenty feet above the ground, and lands on the grass below. It can’t fly. What will happen next?;1532;NULL;2

Yet he also found novel areas of beauty in simple, overlooked corners of American life.

With each stage of division, the strips become progressively thinner (a strip of the 12th division is just 0.08 millimeters\\; further divisions would only become visible by enlargement).

With a spirit of willful reform, this “New Art” style between the 1880s and the First World War inflected architecture, design, painting, graphic work, applied arts, and illustration with a radical rejection of imitative historicism and a new undulating aesthetic of flowing lines and organic forms, ripe with linear freedom and a liberation from artistic tradition and expectation.  Within this repertoire of sensual contours and natural motifs, Art Nouveau also followed the example of the English Arts and Crafts movement to emphasize a return to handcraftsmanship and the synthesis of artistic media and practices into a Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art. In this, as in its turn to nature, Art Nouveau is often seen as an aesthetic response to the Industrial Revolution, a recoil from the mass-produced and mechanic, and an elevation of the human hand and wonders of the great outdoors.;1544;NULL;2

With style and rigor, it has reported on the major themes and stylistic movements in industrial, interior, product, and structural design.This fresh reprint of the 1970s domus coverage brings together the most important features from an era marking seismic changes in architecture and design. It was a time when individualism gained momentum as a novel style, and we began to notice the first postmodernist tendencies. Faced with the global energy crisis, architects and designers imbued their methods with a new ecological awareness. For work to be featured in the magazine it had to offer function, spatial clarity, intellectual persuasion, relevant originality, and/or grace. Those groundbreaking projects and practitioners that made the cut include Shiro Kuramata, Verner Panton, Joe Colombo, Richard Meier, the modernist structures by Foster Associates and the Centre Georges Pompidou by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers.domus distilledSeven volumes spanning 1928 to 1999Over 4,000 pages featuring influential projects by the most important designers and architectsOriginal layouts and all covers, with captions providing navigation and contextIntroductory essays by renowned architects and designersEach edition comes with an appendix featuring texts translated into English, many of which were previously only available in ItalianA comprehensive index in each volume listing both designers’ and manufacturers’ names;1553;NULL;2

Through the years and decades that followed, the journal charted the major themes and movements of industrial, interior, product, and structural design with an eye for creative excellence as much as editorial rigor.  This fresh reprint features domus’s coverage from the transformative years between 1928 and 1939. It is an era famed for the emergence of the International Style when the likes of Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Alvar Aalto, and Richard Neutra channeled modernist ideals into rectilinear forms, restrained surfaces, and open, luminous interiors.

In 1968, when Stanley Kubrick was asked to comment on the metaphysical significance of 2001: A Space Odyssey, he replied: \"It's not a message I ever intended to convey in words. 2001 is a nonverbal experience.... I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious with an emotional and philosophic content.\" The philosophy behind Part 1 of The Stanley Kubrick Archives borrows from this line of thinking: from the opening sequence of Killer's Kiss to the final frames of Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's complete films are presented chronologically and wordlessly via frame enlargements. A completely nonverbal experience.  The second part of the book brings to life the creative process of Kubrick's filmmaking by presenting a remarkable collection of mostly unseen material from his archives, including photographs, props, posters, artwork, set designs, sketches, correspondence, documents, screenplays, drafts, notes, and shooting schedules.  Accompanying the visual material are essays by noted Kubrick scholars, articles written by and about Kubrick, and a selection of Kubrick's best interviews.";1555;NULL;2

Goldberger follows Gehry from his humble origins—the son of working-class Jewish immigrants in Toronto—to the heights of his extraordinary career. He explores Gehry’s relationship to Los Angeles, a city that welcomed outsider artists and profoundly shaped him in his formative years. He surveys the full range of his work, from the Bilbao Guggenheim to the Walt Disney Concert Hall in L.A. to the architect’s own home in Santa Monica, which galvanized his neighbors and astonished the world. He analyzes his carefully crafted persona, in which an amiable surface masks a driving ambition. And he discusses his use of technology, not just to change the way a building looks, but to revolutionize the very practice of the field. Comprehensive and incisive, Building Art is a sweeping view of a singular artist—and an essential story of architecture’s modern era.;1557;NULL;2

He became the leading exponent of a fierce new photographic style that corresponded perfectly to the abrasive and intense climate of Tokyo during a period of great social upheaval. Between June 1972 and July 1973 Moriyama produced his own magazine publication, Kiroku, which was then referred to as Record. It became a diaristic journal of his work as it developed. Ten years ago, after a decades-long interval, he was able to resume publication of Record. Now this book collects work from all thirty published issues, edited into a single sequence, punctuated by Moriyama’s own text as it appeared in the magazine. Produced at the magazine’s original size, with an introduction by Mark Holborn, this volume features more than 200 works from throughout the magazine’s history.  It used to be assumed that Moriyama’s peculiarly Japanese style was tied to his Tokyo roots. The evidence of the last ten years demonstrates that Moriyama, a restless world traveler, has been able to apply his unique vision to northern Europe\\; southern France\\; the cities of Florence, London, Barcelona, Taipei, Hong Kong, New York, and Los Angeles as well as the alleys of Osaka\\; the landscape of Hokkaido\\; and Afghanistan.  230+ illustrations, 50+ in color";1561;NULL;2

Warhol expanded the boundaries by which art is defined and created groundbreaking work in a diverse array of media that includes paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs, films, and installations.   This ambitious book is the first to examine Warhol’s work in its entirety. It builds on a wealth of new research and materials that have come to light in recent decades and offers a rare and much-needed comprehensive look at the full scope of Warhol’s production—from his commercial illustrations of the 1950s through his monumental paintings of the 1980s. Donna De Salvo explores how Warhol’s work engages with notions of public and private, the redefinition of media, and the role of abstraction, while a series of incisive and eye-opening essays by eminent scholars and contemporary artists touch on a broad range of topics, such as Warhol’s response to the AIDS epidemic, his international influence, and how his work relates to constructs of self-image seen in social media today.;1562;by Donna De Salvo (Author), Jessica Beck (Contributor), Okwui Enwezor (Contributor), Trevor Fairbrother (Contributor), Hendrik Folkerts (Contributor), Branden W.

Peter Herring was the center of Anne's universe in college, and now, a few years later, he's become the center of Anna's, and merely a minor player in his ex-girlfriend's world. That is, until Peter and Anna are invited into Anne's parents' home to visit with her dying mother, and he finds himself drawn back into her orbit.  Years later, when her own mother is dying, Anna will find herself yearning to reach out to Anne, with whom she had shared such a brief but intimate bond, and find solace in that moment from long ago. Perspective evolves with time, and so with time, what Peter means to each woman -- as lover, as friend, as connection to the past -- also evolves.  Through exploring Anne's and Anna's ties to Peter and unfolding the narratives of the people who weave meaningfully in and out of their lives, Polly Dugan reveals the power of family secrets, the ripple effects of her characters' emotional choices, and how poignantly their intertwined relationships shape who they are and how they love.  Possessing that rare ability to write the sweep of emotion with tenderness, Polly Dugan invites readers to witness the moments that define her characters -- the moments that come back full circle to comfort or haunt them, or both.

It gave us the Helvetica font and decluttered web design, and it allowed graphic designers to focus with renewed diligence on the relationship between form and function. Today’s resurgence in minimalist graphic design—as creators move away from the ornate, decorative patterns that have saturated our visual culture for the past decade—calls for a closer look at the movement in its new, contemporary context.  Min showcases around 150 outstanding minimalist designers working across a wide range of formats and media—from independent magazines and album cover designs to corporate identity and branding. Three sections—“Reduction,” “Geometry,” and “Production”—define key approaches to minimalism in its visual forms. Each section presents a range of contemporary works, all produced in the past three years. These are accompanied by exclusive interviews with leading practitioners and proponents of minimalist design (Jessica Svendsen, Made Thought, Eric Hu, and others) that offer an in-depth look at their creative processes. Finally, essays tracing the evolution of minimalism in graphic design allow for a useful comparison of the first wave of minimalism in the 1960s to its renascent form today.;1575;NULL;2

Both Sides of Sunset: Photographing Los Angeles reveals these dualities and more, in images captured by master photographers such as Bruce Davidson, Lee Friedlander, Daido Moriyama, Julius Shulman and Garry Winogrand, as well as many younger artists, among them Matthew Brandt, Katy Grannan, Alex Israel, Lise Sarfati and Ed Templeton, just to name a few. Taken together, these individual views by more than 130 artists form a collective vision of a place where myth and reality are often indistinguishable. Spinning off the highly acclaimed Looking at Los Angeles (Metropolis Books, 2005), Both Sides of Sunset presents an updated and equally unromantic vision of this beloved and scorned metropolis. In the years since the first book was published, the artistic landscape of Los Angeles has flourished and evolved. The extraordinary Getty Museum project Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980 focused global attention on the city's artistic heritage, and this interest has only continued to grow. Both Sides of Sunset showcases many of the artists featured in the original book--such as Lewis Baltz, Catherine Opie, Stephen Shore and James Welling--but also incorporates new images that portray a city that is at once unhinged and driven by irrepressible exuberance. Proceeds from the sale of the book will benefit Inner-City Arts--an oasis of learning, achievement and creativity in the heart of Los Angeles' Skid Row that brings arts education to elementary, middle and high school students.;1584;NULL;2

Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983) is among the most extraordinary and inventive in 20th-century design and architecture, not least for its incorporation of a range of intellectual and technical disciplines. Fuller described himself as an “engineer, inventor, mathematician, architect, cartographer, philosopher, poet, cosmogonist, comprehensive designer and choreographer.''  R. Buckminster Fuller: Pattern-Thinking is a major reassessment of Fuller’s legacy in the context of design, examining his singular vision of new conceptual models for design and architecture, alongside his ideas on their potentially world-altering consequences. Drawing extensively on his archive and with over 300 images, the book follows Fuller’s explorations of geometry, language and intellectual property in their relation to design principles and pedagogy, organizing its survey of Fuller’s work through parallel conceptual threads rather than in a linear chronology of his career.;1595;NULL;2

Something as simple as color choices can render a product unusable for millions. These mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. In Mismatch, Kat Holmes describes how design can lead to exclusion, and how design can also remedy exclusion. Inclusive design methods—designing objects with rather than for excluded users—can create elegant solutions that work well and benefit all.  Holmes tells stories of pioneers of inclusive design, many of whom were drawn to work on inclusion because of their own experiences of exclusion. A gamer and designer who depends on voice recognition shows Holmes his “Wall of Exclusion,” which displays dozens of game controllers that require two hands to operate\\; an architect shares her firsthand knowledge of how design can fail communities, gleaned from growing up in Detroit's housing projects\\; an astronomer who began to lose her eyesight adapts a technique called “sonification” so she can “listen” to the stars.  Designing for inclusion is not a feel-good sideline. Holmes shows how inclusion can be a source of innovation and growth, especially for digital technologies. It can be a catalyst for creativity and a boost for the bottom line as a customer base expands. And each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we create an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways.";1597;NULL;2
1598;Sifting the Trash: A History of Design Criticism;Twemlow, Alice;2017;Hardcover;MIT Press;N/A;Good;15;Aaron & Tina's;Design History, Criticism;2;312;9;"Product design criticism operates at the very brink of the landfill site, salvaging some products with praise but consigning others to its depths through condemnation or indifference. When a designed product's usefulness is past, the public happily discards it to make room for the next new thing. Criticism rarely deals with how a product might be used, or not used, over time\\; it is more likely to play the enabler, encouraging our addiction to consumption. With Sifting the Trash, Alice Twemlow offers an especially timely reexamination of the history of product design criticism through the metaphors and actualities of the product as imminent junk and the consumer as junkie.  Twemlow explores five key moments over the past sixty years of product design criticism. From the mid-1950s through the 1960s, for example, critics including Reyner Banham, Deborah Allen, and Richard Hamilton wrote about the ways people actually used design, and invented a new kind of criticism. At the 1970 International Design Conference in Aspen, environmental activists protested the design establishment's lack of political engagement. In the 1980s, left-leaning cultural critics introduced ideology to British design criticism. In the 1990s, dueling London exhibits offered alternative views of contemporary design. And in the early 2000s, professional critics were challenged by energetic design bloggers. Through the years, Twemlow shows, critics either sifted the trash and assigned value or attempted to detect, diagnose, and treat the sickness of a consumer society.";1598;NULL;2

But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the \"girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.";2;First Printing.

Designing this realm carefully is a discipline that is taking on increasing importance today. Gunter Vogt, with his practice in VOGT Landscape Architects and as a professor at ETH Zurich, has developed a set of tools and a working method that incorporate all the different dimensions of the human-designed environment, from the large-scale landscape to the small-scale urban public space.00'Mutation and Morphosis' looks at all the many aspects involved in the collective process of designing and shaping landscapes, from planning to implementation. The model as a tool and the collection as a driving force are illustrated on the basis of an astonishing variety of topics. In theoretical discussions and the examination of detailed dossiers of facts on the ground, a trajectory is traced: from the emergence of new landscapes as a result of climate change to the migration of the wolf to Central Europe, from the impact of invasive plants to the study of geological formation processes.

The coexistence of different visual cultures is now part of our daily lives and a given feature of our communication systems. But how do we best present information, structures and designs from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds?  Visual communication has classically been guided by principles of uniformity and simplification, values that seem unable to adequately cope with the coexistence of different systems of representation. How can we set up equitable systems for cross-cultural communication that honor the diversity of writing systems? What new design values are needed for an age of global communications?  In Visual Coexistence, graphic designer Ruedi Baur leads a research team in investigating and analyzing visual graphics from different cultures, with a focus on Chinese and Latin writing systems, in order to identify their specific principles of depiction and the ways in which they visually communicate. From this interdisciplinary, intercultural investigation, the designers recommend appropriate, differentiated design solutions for global communication. Exploring the problems and possibilities of multilingual typography and visual representation, Visual Coexistence advocates for design as a tool of global understanding.;1631;by Ruedi Baur (Editor, Contributor), Ulrike Felsing (Editor, Contributor), Sébastien Fasel (Contributor), Fabienne Kilchör (Contributor), Eva Lüdi Kong (Contributor), Marco Maione (Contributor), Roman Wilhelm (Contributor);2

It deals with grid-based design and gives the reader techniques to develop new forms, fonts, logos, and patterns. The concept represents a design process in which individual decisions follow much larger and deeper principles than immediate and spontaneous-intuitive actions. Using a wide variety of examples, each chapter contains a detailed description of the procedure from form analysis to setting up design rules and their application. Both a workbook and a source of inspiration, this publication provides designers and architects with the tool they need to find analytical forms analog, algorithm-based, exploratory but never of arbitrary origin. The procedures described allow an almost infinite number of possibilities. The designer is thus transformed from inventor to interpreter or curator, who assesses individual forms for logos, fonts or patterns on the fly and ensures that the design process is always efficient and goal-oriented.

He is active in the fields of corporate, interactive and spatial design, with a strong focus on exploring the limits of interaction and desktop applications.

1646;Exiles;Koudelka, Josef;2014;Hardcover with jacket;Aperture;Koudelka, Josef;Very Good;60;Aaron & Tina's;Photography, Culture, Monographs, Travel;4.2;180;9;About Exiles, Cornell Capa once wrote, Koudelka's unsentimental, stark, brooding, intensely human imagery reflects his own spirit, the very essence of an exile who is at home wherever his wandering body finds haven in the night. In this newly revised and expanded edition of the 1988 classic, which includes ten new images and a new commentary with Robert Delpire, Koudelka's work once more forms a powerful document of the spiritual and physical state of exile. The sense of private mystery that fills these photographs--mostly taken during Koudelka's many years of wandering through Europe and Great Britain since leaving his native Czechoslovakia in 1968--speaks of passion and reserve, of his rage to see. Solitary, moving, deeply felt and strangely disturbing, the images in Exiles suggest alienation, disconnection and love. Exiles evokes some of the most compelling and troubling themes of the twentieth century, while resonating with equal force in this current moment of profound migrations and transience.;1646;NULL;2

Somehow the crew survived, aided by the fact that they emerged into a cloud of gas surrounding a black hole, which provided a breathable atmosphere. Five hundred years later, their descendants still struggle for existence, divided into two main groups. The Miners live on the Belt, a ramshackle ring of dwellings orbiting the core of a dead star, which they excavate for raw materials. These can be traded for food from the Raft, a structure built from the wreckage of the ship, on which a small group of scientists preserve the ancient knowledge which makes survival possible. Rees is a Miner whose curiosity about his world makes him stow away on a flying tree - just one of the many strange local lifeforms - carrying trade between the Belt and the Raft.

In many cases, though, the same sound business practices apply whether you are producing cars or carrots. Author Ben Hartman and other young farmers are increasingly finding that incorporating the best new ideas from business into their farming can drastically cut their wastes and increase their profits, making their farms more environmentally and economically sustainable. By explaining the lean system for identifying and eliminating waste and introducing efficiency in every aspect of the farm operation, The Lean Farm makes the case that small-scale farming can be an attractive career option for young people who are interested in growing food for their community.  Working smarter, not harder, also prevents the kind of burnout that start-up farmers often encounter in the face of long, hard, backbreaking labor.  Lean principles grew out of the Japanese automotive industry, but they are now being followed on progressive farms around the world. Using examples from his own family’s one-acre community-supported farm in Indiana, Hartman clearly instructs other small farmers in how to incorporate lean practices in each step of their production chain, from starting a farm and harvesting crops to training employees and selling goods.;1665;NULL;2

In soaring glass structures or minimalist canvases, we recognize a time of vast technological advance which affirmed the power of human beings to reshape their environment and to break, radically, from the conventions or constraints of the past. Less well-known, but no less fascinating, is the distillation of modernism in graphic design.  This unprecedented TASCHEN publication, authored by Jens Müller, brings together approximately 6,000 trademarks, focused on the period 1940–1980, to examine how modernist attitudes and imperatives gave birth to corporate identity. Ranging from media outfits to retail giants, airlines to art galleries, the sweeping survey is organized into three design-orientated chapters: Geometric, Effect, and Typographic. Each chapter is then sub-divided into form and style led sections such as alphabet, overlay, dots and squares.  Alongside the comprehensive catalog, the book features an introduction from Jens Müller on the history of logos, and an essay by R. Roger Remington on modernism and graphic design. Eight designer profiles and eight instructive case studies are also included, with a detailed look at the life and work of such luminaries as Paul Rand, Yusaku Kamekura, and Anton Stankowski, and at such significant projects as Fiat, The Daiei Inc., and the Mexico Olympic Games of 1968. An unrivaled resource for graphic designers, advertisers, and branding specialists, Logo Modernism is equally fascinating to anyone interested in social, cultural, and corporate history, and in the sheer persuasive power of image and form.;1667;NULL;2

In his photographs time appears to stand still: neighbourhoods that once possessed the allure of Art Deco architecture, or the glory of bustling Main Streets, are now home to abandoned school buildings and cars parked decades ago.

With more than 1,400 illustrations, many of them never published before and written by the leading design historian Pat Kirkham, this is the definitive study that design and film enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating. Saul Bass (1920-1996) created some of the most compelling images of American post-war visual culture. Having extended the remit of graphic design to include film titles, he went on to transform the genre. His best known works include a series of unforgettable posters and title sequences for films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo and Otto Preminger's The Man With The Golden Arm and Anatomy of a Murder. He also created some of the most famous logos and corporate identity campaigns of the century, including those for major companies such as AT&T, Quaker Oats, United Airlines and Minolta. His wife and collaborator, Elaine, joined the Bass office in the late 1950s. Together they created an impressive series of award-winning short films, including the Oscar-winning Why Man Creates, as well as an equally impressive series of film titles, ranging from Stanley Kubrick s Spartacus in the early 1960s to Martin Scorsese s Cape Fear and Casino in the 1990s. Designed by Jennifer Bass, Saul Bass's daughter and written by distinguished design historian Pat Kirkham who knew Saul Bass personally, this book is full of images from the Bass archive, providing an in depth account of one of the leading graphic artists of the 20th century.;1670;Birthday present from Tina;2

The first \"Studio Culture\" book didn't cover many of the major changes in the design landscape that we now take for granted: the importance of social media\\; the use of coding in visual design\\; timely calls for more diversity\\; and that's before we mention the global trauma of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. From today's vantage point, the world of 2009 feels like ancient history. It became apparent that our only option was to make an entirely new book. One that took into account the changes that have affected everyone who works in design, and the challenges facing students emerging into the uncertain terrain of professional graphic design. An extensive 'Studio Intelligence' section provides a checklist covering vital topics such as the benefits and pitfalls of remote working, space sharing, professional help and social media policies.";1679;First edition. ;2
1680;The Anarchist's Workbench;Schwarz, Christopher;2020;Hardcover;Lost Art Press;Schwarz, Christopher;Very Good;60;Aaron & Tina's;Carpentry, Woodworking, Design;1.2;323;9;"The book is on the one hand - a detailed plan for a simple workbench that can be built using construction lumber and basic woodworking tools. But it's also the story of Christopher Schwarz's 20-year journey researching, building and refining historical workbenches until there was nothing left to improve. Along the way, Schwarz quits his corporate job, builds a publishing company founded on the principles of mutualism and moves into an 1896 German barroom in a red-light district, where he now builds furniture, publishes books and tries to live as an aesthetic anarchist. \"The Anarchist's Workbench\" is the third and final book in the \"anarchist\" series, and it attempts to cut through the immense amount of misinformation about building a proper bench. It helps answer the questions that dog every woodworker: What sort of bench should I build? What wood should I use? What dimensions should it be? And what vises should I attach to it? These questions are answered with the perspective of 2,000 years of workbench history";1680;NULL;2
1681;Richard Stark's Parker, Vol. 1: The Hunter;Stark, Richard;2009;Hardcover with jacket;"IDW Publishing\\;";Cooke, Darwyn;Very Good;30;Aaron & Tina's;Graphic Novel, Mystery, Thriller;1.28;160;9;Darwyn Cooke’s beautifully stylized artwork perfectly compliments the hard-hitting action as originally written by legendary crime author Richard Stark. Parker is arguably one of the hardest hard-boiled characters in all of crime fiction and the original novels feature stories and prose that are as uncompromising as he is. This graphic novel adaptation perfectly matches the style and tone of Stark’s noir world.  The Hunter is the story of a man who hits New York head-on like a shotgun blast to the chest. Betrayed by the woman he loved and double-crossed by his partner in crime, Parker makes his way cross-country with only one thought burning in his mind — to coldly exact his revenge and reclaim what was taken from him!;1681;Present from Josh to Aaron;2

Essays include: '2012 Olympic logo ate my hamster'\\; 'Vaughan Oliver - minotaurs in suburban England'\\; and 'The myth of originality and the joy of copying'. The essays have appeared on blogs such as Design Observer, and in publications such as Eye, Creative Review, Design Week and The Wire. Many others have appeared only in tiny circulation publications. The book's introduction opens with a disconcerting question: 'Why would anyone want to read about graphic design?' Despite assertions that 'designers don't read', there has, in recent years, been a huge upsurge of interest in design writing: courses have been established to teach the subject, and many designers now combine design and writing within their practices. In 2003, Adrian Shaughnessy gave up studio life to become an independent designer, consultant, publisher, teacher and writer. He wrote the highly successful How to be a Graphic Designer Without Losing your Soul which has sold 80,000 copies worldwide.

1720;Interpreter of Maladies;Lahiri, Jhumpa;1999;Paperback;Houghton Mifflin;N/A;Used;0;Aaron & Tina's;Fiction, Short Stories;0.6;198;0;With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence, Jhumpa Lahiri traces the crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants, expatriates, and their children arrive, quite literally, at a cultural divide.   A blackout forces a young Indian American couple to make confessions that unravel their tattered domestic peace. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural identity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakastani civil war rages on television in the background. A latchkey kid with a single working mother finds affinity with a woman from Calcutta. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession.  Imbued with the sensual details of Indian culture, these stories speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has ever felt like a foreigner.

But there's never been a book that tells its story - until now.  Led by founder and born rebel, Ian Anderson, The Designers Republic(tm) has shaped graphic communication over the past thirty years through rule-defying music work, provocative self-initiated projects and a fierce commitment to conceptual thinking over style. Now, for the first time in book form, Anderson explores the studio's output, and its influence on a generation of graphic designers.  AZTDR(tm) spans over three decades of work - from the studio's earliest designs for the FON label in the mid-1980s and sleeves for Age of Chance, Chakk and Cabaret Voltaire, right up to its recent projects for The Cinematic Orchestra, Led Bib and the Gulbenkian Foundation. Alongside classic self-initiated TDR(tm) projects, the 512-page book features an A to Z of everything from campaigns for Evolution Print, Coca-Cola and Nike, through to the studio's celebrated designs for video games such as Wipeout and Formula Fusion.  TDR(tm)'s special relationship with print is explored through its celebrated contributions to IDEA and Emigre magazines and its 3D>2D book, alongside its work for Manchester School of Art, Gatecrasher, NY Sushi and the studio's array of music clients. Here, TDR(tm)'s work with Autechre is examined via ten key releases, while the studio's involvement with Pop Will Eat Itself focuses on some twenty-eight different singles and albums. There are also expansive sections devoted to TDR(tm)'s designs for Aphex Twin, Moloko, Sun Electric and The Orb, alongside sleeve designs for R&S Records, New Atlantis, a range of Berlin-based labels and, of course, Warp Records.;1734;Edition of 500, ;2

In Deformer he presented the photographs under the theme of suburbia. Wayward Cognitions represents the in-between moments that arise when shooting in the streets without theme or subject. \"It's about looking, people watching, finding pleasure in the visual vignettes we glimpse each day,\" says Templeton.

That was the first edition of the so-called Strunk & White, which Time recognized in 2011 as one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.

1786;Breakfast of Champions;Vonnegut, Kurt;1973;Paperback;Delta Book (Dell);Vonnegut, Kurt;Used;15;Aaron & Tina's;Fiction, Novel;0.8;295;N;"Breakfast of Champions (1973) provides frantic, scattershot satire and a collage of Vonnegut's obsessions. His recurring cast of characters and American landscape was perhaps the most controversial of his canon\\; it was felt by many at the time to be a disappointing successor to Slaughterhouse-Five, which had made Vonnegut's literary reputation.  The core of the novel is Kilgore Trout, a familiar character very deliberately modeled on the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (1918-1985), a fact that Vonnegut conceded frequently in interviews and that was based upon his own occasional relationship with Sturgeon. Here Kilgore Trout is an itinerant wandering from one science fiction convention to another\\; he intersects with the protagonist, Dwayne Hoover (one of Vonnegut's typically boosterish, lost, and stupid mid-American characters), and their intersection is the excuse for the evocation of many others, familiar and unfamiliar, dredged from Vonnegut's gallery. The central issue is concerned with intersecting and apposite views of reality, and much of the narrative is filtered through Trout, who is neither certifiably insane nor a visionary writer but can pass for either depending upon Dwayne Hoover's (and Vonnegut's) view of the situation.  America, when this novel was published, was in the throes of Nixon, Watergate, and the unraveling of our intervention in Vietnam\\; the nation was beginning to fragment ideologically and geographically, and Vonnegut sought to cram all of this dysfunction (and a goofy, desperate kind of hope, the irrational comfort given through the genre of science fiction) into a sprawling narrative whose sense, if any, is situational, not conceptual. Reviews were polarized\\; the novel was celebrated for its bizarre aspects and became the basis of a Bruce Willis movie adaptation whose reviews were not nearly so polarized.

The human machine is the body as not only a fixed framework but also as a complex work of art which moves and was designed to move. In over 400 drawings, George B. Bridgman demonstrates the machine through the presentations which made him a gifted lecturer and teacher in his nearly fifty years at the Art Students League in New York and which gave life to drawings by his many students during those years. All skeletal and muscular systems are fully identified, and all are shown in front, back, and side views. The Human Machine begins with the framework of bones. In each section (head, neck, hand, arm, forearm, elbow, trunk, shoulder, back, scapular region, pelvis, hip, thigh, leg, knee, foot, and toe as well as the combinations of the major sections working together), George Bridgman starts with the skeletal components of the system\\; then he adds the muscles, shows the changes in the muscles as the body moves and, finally, shows the appearance of the bodily section in action. At the title implies, Bridgman, throughout, supplements his anatomical work with comparative drawings of simple machines. The anatomical approach to figure drawing is the foundation for the study of human form, and as in his other books on figure drawing, Bridgman's Life Drawing and The Book of a Hundred Hands, Bridgman's approach to the subject is important and unique. The Human Machine will give students and serious artists the conception of the human structure as the complex of beautiful machines it is, and will show how bone and muscle structures are solely responsible for our movements and for the shapes which we, at various times, display.";1797;"\"Luke Kapor, 11/25/79, San Francisco\" written on the inside.";2

The Tale of Peter Rabbit was first published by Frederick Warne in 1902 and endures as Beatrix Potter's most popular and well-loved tale. It tells the story of a very mischievous rabbit and the trouble he encounters in Mr McGregor's vegetable garden! Re-originated in 2002 to mark the centenary of publication bringing it closer to the original edition, six illustrations were restored, four that were removed in 1903 to make room for endpapers and two that have never been used before, Beatrix having initially prepared more illustrations than could be accommodated in the original format. Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.;1826;"#1 of 23 \"Little Books\"";2

The story focuses on the legendary Swiss marksman William Tell as part of the greater Swiss struggle for independence from the Habsburg Empire in the early 14th century. The fateful enmity of the tyrant Gessler, Governor of the Swiss cantons, and William Tell, an obscure huntsman, begins during a tempest on Lake Lucerne when Tell braves the angry waves to row to safety a peasant who is pursued by the Governor's horsemen. \"The lake may take pity on him\\; but the Governor, never,\" says Tell. His opinion of the bloodthirsty Gessler is shared increasingly by the peasantry as the oppressor fills the old jails, builds a huge new prison at Altdorf for more victims, and sets his cap upon a pole before it, commanding that all who pass must bow to it or pay the penalty of death. Public anger is fanned into rebellion when Gessler blinds an aged man for a trifling misdemeanor. Tell, the individualist, holds aloof from the rebels' councils, but promises his aid when needed.";1836;Slipcase and Sandglass missing. ;2

Today forty-three of his plays are known by title\\; eleven survive. The most famous of these is the whimsical fantasy Lysistrata.  A perennial classroom and stage favorite as well as the basis of Spike Lee's Chi-Raq, the play is as relevant today as it was 2,500 years ago. The premise is simplicity itself: to end the Peloponnesian War, women decide to withhold sex from their husbands until the fighting stops.  The play is by turns raucous, bawdy, frantic, and funny. David Mulroy's exciting new translation retains the original's verse format, racy jokes, and vibrancy-setting it apart from previous efforts, which are typically reproduced as prose or depart from meaning and meter. His introduction offers a concise summary of Aristophanes' life and social milieu, including a brief overview of the Peloponnesian War, which took place during the playwright's lifetime. The appendices include guides on translating meter and Greek pronunciation for aspiring thespians.";4;Sandglass included.;2

1450;Merce Cunningham: Common Time;N/A;2017;Hardcover;Walker Art Center;N/A;Like New;40;Aaron & Tina's;Collections, Catalogs & Exhibitions;5.07;456;9;"Renowned as both choreographer and dancer, Merce Cunningham (1919-2009) also revolutionized dance through his partnerships with the many artists who created costumes, lighting, films and videos, and décor and sound for his choreographic works. Cunningham, together with partner John Cage, invited those artists to help him rethink what dance could mean, both on the stage and in site-responsive contexts. His notion that movement, sound and visual art could share a \"common time\" remains one of the most radical aesthetic models of the 20th century and yielded extraordinary works by dozens of artists and composers, including Charles Atlas, John Cage, Morris Graves, Jasper Johns, Rei Kawakubo, Robert Morris, Gordon Mumma, Bruce Nauman, Ernesto Neto, Pauline Oliveros, Nam June Paik, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, David Tudor, Stan VanDerBeek, Andy Warhol and La Monte Young, among many others. These collaborations bring to the fore Cunningham's direct impact upon postwar artistic practice.  This 456-page volume, published in conjunction with the Walker Art Center and MCA Chicago's exhibition, reconsiders the choreographer and his collaborators as an extraordinarily generative interdisciplinary network that preceded and predicted dramatic shifts in performance, including the development of site-specific dance, the use of technology as a choreographic tool and the radical separation of sound and movement in dance. It features ten new essays by curators and historians, as well as interviews with contemporary choreographers--Beth Gill, Maria Hassabi, Rashaun Mitchell and Silas Riener--who address Cunningham's continued influence. These are supplemented by rarely published archival photographs, reprints of texts by Cunningham, Cage and other key dancers, artists and scholars, several appendices and an extensive illustrated chronology placing Cunningham's activities and those of his collaborators in the context of the 20th century, particularly the expanded arts scene of the 1960s and 1970s. This book is an essential volume for anyone interested in contemporary art, music and dance.";1450;NULL;2
1492;Decade;McCabe, Aemmon;2010;Hardcover;Phaidon;Various;Good;8;Aaron & Tina's;Photography, Culture;6.57;504;9;A successor to Phaidon's award-winning Century: One Hundred Years of Human Progress, Suffering, Regression and Hope (1999), Decade provides a comprehensive visual overview of the last 10 years in world history. Adhering to the same standards of historical accuracy and scholarship as its predecessor, this book offers a sensitive anthology of 10 years in photography that will appeal to readers of all ages and interests. Decade presents 500 engaging photographic images, both iconic and idiosyncratic, selected by acclaimed photo editor Eamonn McCabe and arranged in chronological order to tell the story of the first decade in our new millennium. The shorter historical span of this book, compared to Century, allows this sequence to explore more deeply developments in art, architecture, sport and technology, alongside key moments in international political affairs, so that the reader encounters surprising moments from our history alongside those familiar from coverage in the mass media. Global in scope, these photographs tackle subjects ranging from the World Trade Center attacks of '9/11' to the AIDS epidemic in Africa, from the first tests of the Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva, to the death of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. Award-winning documentary photography sits alongside the new 'citizen journalism', which has seen ordinary bystanders capture historic events equipped with nothing more sophisticated than a mobile phone camera. Each image is accompanied by both a short descriptive and an extended, historical caption, to provide a wider context within which to understand these often beautiful, always surprising, photographs. 15 historical and thematic essays are also included, exploring the events, trends and social phenomena that have characterized the decade. Engaging with debates in photography, while providing a visual record of world events both regional and international, this book provides an extraordinary insight into our recent history - dramatic, nostalgic, intimate and educational by turns.;1492;NULL;2

1573;The Great Gatsby;Fitzgerald, F. Scott;1953;Paperback;Charles Scribner's Sons;N/A;Used;30;Aaron & Tina's;Fiction, Novel;1;182;9;"In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write \"something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned.\" That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. \"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--\" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream. It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. \"Her voice is full of money,\" Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout.";1573;NULL;2

Bill Campbell played an instrumental role in the growth of several prominent companies, such as Google, Apple, and Intuit, fostering deep relationships with Silicon Valley visionaries, including Steve Jobs, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt. In addition, this business genius mentored dozens of other important leaders on both coasts, from entrepreneurs to venture capitalists to educators to football players, leaving behind a legacy of growing companies, successful people, respect, friendship, and love after his death in 2016.  Leaders at Google for over a decade, Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, and Alan Eagle experienced firsthand how the man fondly known as Coach Bill built trusting relationships, fostered personal growth—even in those at the pinnacle of their careers—inspired courage, and identified and resolved simmering tensions that inevitably arise in fast-moving environments. To honor their mentor and inspire and teach future generations, they have codified his wisdom in this essential guide.  Based on interviews with over eighty people who knew and loved Bill Campbell, Trillion Dollar Coach explains the Coach’s principles and illustrates them with stories from the many great people and companies with which he worked.
